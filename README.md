# SQAHandbook - Overview
This project is for a handbook which describes how to write top quality code in Java. 
There are examples in this project of Java Coding conventions in use and examples of Unit Test cases using JUnit 4.

## Environment Setup
To view these examples we encourage the use of Eclipse. You can download the source code and import it into your Eclipse project.

## Running the JUnit Test Case
When running the JUnit test case in your Eclipse IDE you should get a passing result - i.e. a green bar indictaing the test was successful.
To familiarize yourself with how test cases are run and work, we suggest you change some of the cases around to gice wrong results and look
for the failing result - i.e. a red bar indicating the test was not successful.
